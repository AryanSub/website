            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>
                Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, <br/>
                rhythm or otherwise expressive content. <br/>
                Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, <br/> 
                a cultural universal. <br/> 
            </p>
            <p>
                What is music? Music is an art form that combines either vocal or instrumental sounds, sometimes both, using form,  <br/>
                harmony, and expression of emotion to convey an idea. Music represents many different forms that play key factors  <br/>
                in cultures around the world. A description of music, when asked by musicians, is quite challenging for them to put  <br/>
                into a words.  <br/> <br/>
                There is something unique, unto each artist, which music makes people feel a specific way in the world. John Coltrane <br/>
                described his music as, ''My music is the spiritual expression of what I am my faith, my knowledge, my being. When you  <br/>
                begin to see the possibilities of music, your desire to do something really good for people, to help humanity free itself  <br/>
                from its hang ups. I want to speak to their souls.

                Music is the art form that combines rhythm and sound to form a functional melodic line. Music itself transcends time, space,<br/>
                and cultures. Music can carry a mood without speaking any specific words. It can also be captured and recorded in a written <br/> 
                universal language unique unto any other art form. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The history of music is a lengthy topic which requires much depth and time. Music is an ancient art form that began during prehistoric times. <br/>
                It carries with it a history for each human culture throughout time. Although there are many varied definitions of music, it is a cultural universal <br/>
                because every culture throughout time and history has made music a primary component of life. For ages, music was passed down through oral tradition on <br/>
                a fundamental level; but for formal purposes, recorded music began with the written tradition by medieval monks during 500 AD to 1400.
